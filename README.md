Managing highly dimensional electronic health record data for machine learning models: improving predictions of 30-day hospital readmissions and mortality

Files 1-3: data pre-processing

Files 4, 5: random forest model with all dimensionality reduction implementations (ISOMAP has a much longer execution time, so it is separated out)

Files 6: SVM model with each dimensionality reduction implementation

Files 7: neural network model with each dimensionality reduction implementation

File 8: evaluation metrics
