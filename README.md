Managing highly dimensional EHR data to improve predictions of 30-day readmissions and mortality: investigating dimensionality reduction techniques for machine learning

Files 1-3: data pre-processing
Files 4, 5: random forest model with all dimensionality reduction implementations (ISOMAP has a much longer execution time, so it is separated out)
Files 6: SVM model with each dimensionality reduction implementation
Files 7: neural network model with each dimensionality reduction implementation
File 8: evaluation metrics
